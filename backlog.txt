BUGS:

1ST BUG: In Edit Profile, there may be bug when taking a picture or library using 
ImagePicker library. Camera or Library screen does not go in full screen. See the
below that happens in only iOS devices based on version 14.5+, Android is fine. It may be 
fixed as soon as possible. So I will just leave it until it is fixed.
