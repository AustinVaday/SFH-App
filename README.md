# SFH-App
A new, revolutionary sign language learning experience.

# Instructions:

If you have not installed Expo-Cli, do this:

1. If you have downloaded Node.js, skip to step 2.
   Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) (Prefers Current version, not LTS)

2. In your command line, type `npm install --global expo-cli` (for Mac). If for Windows, 
   type `npm install expo-cli --global`.


To run the app:

1. After cloning, do `npm install` if your npm version in 6.0.0+ or do `npm install -force` if
   your npm version in 7.0.0+. If there are errors, delete package-lock.json and node_modules (if the file there) then do again.

2. After that, do `npm start` or `npm start --reset-cache`
